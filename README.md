VR Banking Project
Overview
This project demonstrates a VR-based banking experience where users can interact with a virtual bank, apply for loans, and get real-time feedback. The project uses A-Frame for the VR environment, speech recognition and synthesis for user interaction, and Salesforce integration to handle backend processes like loan applications.

Features
VR Environment: Users can interact with a 3D virtual bank, such as submitting loan applications or interacting with virtual employees.
Voice Interaction: Speech recognition is used to gather user input, and speech synthesis is used to provide responses.
Salesforce Integration: Loan applications are submitted to Salesforce, and user data is stored using the Salesforce API.
3D Models: The virtual bank office includes 3D models representing different bank areas (e.g., help desk, loan department) and characters for an immersive experience.

Interaction Flow
Click Event: When the user clicks on the VR component, the conversation starts.
Voice Recognition: Questions are asked, and user input is collected using speech recognition.
Salesforce API: Once the conversation is complete, a loan application is created using Salesforce's API.
Resetting: After interaction, the experience resets to handle the next user.
JavaScript Files
interaction.js
This file manages user interaction, starting from clicking on a VR element to handling the entire conversation flow. It integrates with the Salesforce API by calling createSalesforceApplication() after collecting user input.

salesforce-integration.js
This file handles connecting to Salesforce and managing CRUD operations for loan applications.

Key functions: - startConversation(): Initiates the loan application conversation. - askNextQuestion(): Asks the next question and starts speech recognition. - handleResponse(): Processes user responses and moves on to the next question. - confirmAnswers(): Confirms user answers before submission. - createSalesforceApplication(): Submits the loan application data to Salesforce.

Key functions: - connect(): Establishes a connection to Salesforce using jsforce. - createLoanApplication(applicationData): Creates a new loan application in Salesforce with the provided data. - queryLoanApplication(applicationId): Retrieves an existing loan application by its ID.
